# WTWR (What to Wear?)

WTWR is an application that filiters through clothes to wear based on the tempature in your area. You can create an account and add and remove items that you added to the app. You can also like items that you added and that have been added by others when your logged in.

## About the project

The idea of the application is pretty simple - we make a call to an API, which then responds with the daily weather forecast. We collect the weather data, process it, and then based on the forecast, we recommend suitable clothing to the user. The site use react components with jsx, javascript for most functionality, and css for styling.
